- 👋 Hi, I’m @3rr0r445
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about computers and how they work, after a couple decades of not knowing what I'm doing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Web Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but I'm always open to suggestions.
- 📫 How to reach me: You don't. Yet.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm desperately trying to get into web dev or coding in general. I work retail and there is nothing here for me, nor room for growth or improvement.
